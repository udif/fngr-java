 * 
 * Modifications (by Udi Finkelstein):
 * 1. Change arguments from Strings to byte[] to prevent needless copying
 * 2. Added length + offset to support future heuristics of running a batch of smaller levenshtein runs on very large files
 * 3. Turned methods into static so we don't need to create a useless class object that holds no state.

     * It is always at least the difference of the sizes of the two strings.
     * It is at most the length of the longer string.
     * It is zero if and only if the strings are equal.
     * If the strings are the same size, the Hamming distance is an upper bound
     * on the Levenshtein distance.
     * The Levenshtein distance verifies the triangle inequality (the distance
     * between two strings is no greater than the sum Levenshtein distances from
     * a third string).
     *
     * Implementation uses dynamic programming (Wagnerâ€“Fischer algorithm), with
     * only 2 rows of data. The space requirement is thus O(m) and the algorithm
     * runs in O(mn).
     *
     * This implementation works on a sub-range of byte arrays (length+offset)
     * but these are allowed to wrap around!
     * The intended usage is to work on large files - instead of having an O(N*M) time
     * we split them into smaller K bites, having those bites overlap
     * 
     * @param b1 The first byte array to compare.
     * @param b2 The second byte array to compare.
     * @param offset1 Where to start checking the 1st byte array
     * @param offset1 Where to start checking the 2nd byte array
     * @param length1 How many bytes to check on the 1st byte array
     * @param length2 How many bytes to check on the 2nd byte array
     * @param limit The maximum result to compute before stopping. This
     *              means that the calculation can terminate early if you
     *              only care about strings with a certain similarity.
     *              Set this to Integer.MAX_VALUE if you want to run the
     *              calculation to completion in every case.
